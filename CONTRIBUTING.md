# How to contribute 

## Requesting new plugins
Consider adding your plugin to your local configuration, if you feel everyone
would benefit from it:

- Create settings file: `config/plugins/<plugin name>.vim`
- Add: `Plug '<user>/<repo>'` to the appropriate section of `Plug.vim`
- Update the README outlining quick usage of the plugin
